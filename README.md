# flow-random-access-tokens

WordPress plugin to create and store random access tokens against posts and users. Makes use of the [https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat](paragonie/random_compat) library.

One use of random tokens (and the reason I wrote this plugin) is to obfuscate public URLs.
